## Agenda

### Curriculum status: maintainers integrated a lot of pull requests leading up to the AAS

* There has been a fair amount of pull requests integrated by mantainers. The requests included things like updating requirements, changing small things in the curriculum. See more in the public [Github repo of the lessons](https://github.com/datacarpentry/astronomy-python).

### Curriculum would benefit from a *lead* maintainer

* It would be a good idea to have a *lead* maintainer who coordinates a bit more the work done by all maintainers. We do not know if this type of position exists in other Carpentry curricula. 

* The idea would be for a *lead* maintainer not to do all the work, but coordinate who does what organizing co-working sessions so that all issues and pull requests are taken care of.  

    - Everyone found this is to be a good idea  

* One of the questions we have is how often is the material being used(?).   
    
    - We do not have an answer for this.  
    - (Heather) I include part of the material of the *Visualization lesson* whenever I teach the Python lesson of the Software Carpentry.

### Most recent workshops: AAS

* There was a new instructor for the workshop and there was also Iva (who has taught the lesson before). It was full and they got very good feedback from the audience. They also got to do everything on time.  

* There was 1 issue that someone opened related to this workshop.

* How much time did the in-person workshop required?  

    - It was taught in 2 days. From 9.00 to 17.00 with breaks (12 hours of lesson). There was 1 hour extra on the first day (from 8.00 to 9.00) to deal with installation problems.  

* Moving from online to in-person may change timings a bit, but it may depend on the level of the learners.

### Invite maintainers to CAC meetings? 

* We currently have 3 maintainers. It would be a good idea to invite the maintainers to this meeting (or at least the lead maintainer). 

    - Everyone found this is to be a good idea  

### CAC succession 

* This is usually discussed after 1.5-2 years in the role. 

* We have all started around the same time (first Astronomy CAC). So it would be a good idea if we all get to think about whether we want to remain in the role or not.  

    - Azalee will also send an email around (probably talk to Erin first to see if they also have a plan for this).

    - (Rachel and Heather) I would like to stay on this role.  

## Wrap-up

* To discuss with Erin/Toby:  

    - New maintainer call
    - Impact of Carpentries Workbench switch.  
        
        Apparently none of us has been able to attend the informative sessions about it. But it seems like they are applying changes to all current lessons. See https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/01/dovetail-14/  
        
        Azalee will contact Erin or Toby to see if it is possible to get more info about this.


* To discuss in an up-coming meeting:  

    - (Azalee) How do we recruit community members who have the time and are willing to get involved as maintainers? 
    - (Rachel) Is there a way of keeping track of how people are using the material? Maybe we can discuss this in our next meeting.

        - [AMY](https://carpentries.org/upcoming_workshops/) should have information about what workshops are being carried out worldwide. The pre and post-workshop surveys are also registered in AMY. For next meeting: we can ask Erin or Toby how can we retrieve the information from AMY or get any information about how many workshops are being carried out. Azalee will ask Erin or Toby about this.

        Rachel will follow up with colleagues about the structure of the lesson (perhaps more modular development).
