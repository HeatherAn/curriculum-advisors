# Curriculum Advisory Committees 

This repository serves as a public record of meeting notes and decisions made by the Curriculum Advisory Committees (CACs) for Data Carpentry lessons. 

Information
about CAC structure and duties can be found in [The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committees). Current membership of each CAC can be accessed on the [Data Carpentry website](https://datacarpentry.org/curriculum-advisors/).

### How to Record Minutes

For each meeting, the CAC Secretary will create a minutes file with a title of the format `MONTH-YYYY-CURRICULUM-minutes.md` (e.g. March-2022-genomics.md). 
The Secretary will submit a pull request. The Chair will review the pull
request, make any necessary changes, and approve the minutes by merging the pull request. 

Each set of minutes should include: 

- Date and time of meeting
- Names of those in attendance
- Agenda items discussed and a summary of each discussion
- The outcomes of any votes taken
