### How to Record Minutes

For each meeting, the CAC Secretary will create a minutes file with a title of the format `MONTH-YYYY-CURRICULUM-minutes.md` (e.g. March-2022-genomics.md). 
The Secretary will submit a pull request. The Chair will review the pull
request, make any necessary changes, and approve the minutes by merging the pull request. 

Each set of minutes should include: 

- Date and time of meeting
- Names of those in attendance
- Agenda items discussed and a summary of each discussion
- The outcomes of any votes taken
