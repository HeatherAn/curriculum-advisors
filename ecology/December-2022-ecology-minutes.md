## Agenda

### Introductions

All participants told about their day job, and how they got involved with the Carpentries.

### Carpentries lessons
We discussed the history and structure of the Carpentries lessons.

### Revamped R Lesson
There is a new R lesson in development (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/R-ecology-lesson/). We would like to ask the developer to join the next meeting and present the new materials. The maintainers of the current lesson should also be informed. We should discuss whether the new lesson will replace the current one or not, or perhaps both lessons will be offered side by side (as is the case for the R and Python lessons in Software Carpenty).  

### OpenRefine lesson
The maintainer of the OpenRefine lesson has a large list of suggested changes to the lesson (https://github.com/datacarpentry/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/pull/276#issuecomment-1305476351). One of those involves changes to the datafile and therefore the CAC should be consulted. We should look through the changes to decide if it should be accepted. This does not have to wait till the next meeting, but everyone can look at the changes in their own time and communitate their thoughts. 


### Communications
We came to the following preferred communication channels.
- Main internal commmunication: **TopicBox** (*note that all communication on TopicBox is public*)
- Communicate with lesson maintainers: **Github issues**
- Gathering feedback, communicating with instructors, etc.: **Carpentry Slack channels**

### Next meeting
Next meeting should take place end of March.
