## Previous meeting notes

- No additions

## Move towards shared chair responsibilities in the future

- Mike would like to step down as chair (not as committee member) to lower workload
- Since there is no candidate to take over this role, we decided to share the responsabilities by rotating the function of chair among CAC members.

## Decision on new R Lesson

- We got limited feedback on recent deliveries mentioned at last meeting -- other than informal "It went well".
- We would like go forward with approval -- which will open the gates to more focus and improvement.
- Mike will email Toby that we do approve
- Ask Toby about the next in terms of rollout -- blog post, community call, etc.

**Next Meeting: Wednesday May 15, 2024**
