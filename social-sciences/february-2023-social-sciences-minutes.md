**February 2023 Meeting of the Social Sciences Curriculum Advisors**
**Date:** Monday, February 27, 2023 at 10hs (GTM-3)

**Attending:** Nathaniel Porter, Eirini Zormpa, Macarena Quiroga, Daniel Woulfin

**Topics discussed:**
 - Organization of the Committee: introductions, committee structure review, meeting times, communication channels. 
    - Decisions: we will meet again in June 2023, we’ll work asynchronously in the meantime in the slack channel.
 - Review of the leftover issues from previous meeting in 2018 (adding a section on join in the R lesson) and new issues (the data is not messy enough for the OpenRefine lesson, transition to the Workbench). 
    - Decision: we’ll discuss asynchronously which merging function should be added and how to improve the messiness of the data, to arrive to a conclusion in our next meeting.
