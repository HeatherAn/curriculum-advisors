### Agenda

### Notes

- Marianne and Josh sent apologies.
- Ulf: Repository seems fairly stable, currently one [PR](https://github.com/datacarpentry/image-processing/pull/323) on loading the coordinates for the well plates. Uses `np.loadtxt` and is relatively intuitive to understand and perhaps closer to practical applications.
- Erick's group has taught a workshop using the curriculum as a starting point and making some changes (especially on example data) - will invite Kiya to join a future meeting to provide feedback and ask for feedback survey results
- Next quarterly meeting some time in September
- Adjourned ca. 20:10 UTC
