### Agenda

* Report back from Curriculum Advisors Open Office Hours
    - recent changes in core team mean limited resources for core team to support CACs
        - Josh and Ulf participated in one of the calls (meeting notes: https://pad.carpentries.org/2024-01-15-0900-discussing-cac-support)
        - Toby won't be able to provide the same level of support to the CACs as he has so far
        - It's up to us (CAC members) to decide how we want to proceed: self-organization
        - How do you become/remain a CAC member?
        - We are de facto Benevolent Dictators
        - We are fairly optimistic that the CAC will continue for a while
        - We are > 3 for now
* Event recap: Online short course coordinated by University of Delaware, IHRS BioSoft, BIF-IGS, and HIDSS4Health https://events.hifis.net/event/1198/#day-2024-01-16
    - Ulf's slides: https://zenodo.org/records/10547352
    - It was an online course organized by German institutes over 4 half-days
    - ~40 students, not all beginners
    - Hands-on exercises were done using break-out rooms
    - It went well
    - Ulf shared the paper on best practices for publishing image data
    - Ulf shared pointers to resources
    - Students using their own IDEs: "it's on you" Erick says (Marianne +1)
    - Ulf didn't use domain-specific image data (maybe in a follow-up course?)
    - Ulf taught more theory on convolution (also because of the current interest in neural networks...)
    * possible side effect: feedback for open issues [Reduce number of unique images used? #39](https://github.com/datacarpentry/image-processing/issues/39) and/or [Reduce number of jpeg images used #81](https://github.com/datacarpentry/image-processing/issues/81)?
        * Didn't appear as major issues
* Erick will teach a workshop in March (19, 26) and will report at the next CAC meeting
    * Image data will be changed to what the students use in real life, in this case, biological images
* We discussed our respective and potential participation in conferences this year
* Date for next meeting: May 29, 2024
